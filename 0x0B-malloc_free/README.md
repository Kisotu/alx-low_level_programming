Memory allocation: the process of dynamically allocating memory to store data.

 - This is done using the malloc() function, which stands for "memory allocation".
 - Memory allocated with malloc() must be explicitly freed using free() when it is no longer needed. 
 - Failure to do so can result in memory leaks, which can cause a program to consume more and more memory over time.
